#OpenBCI Narcolepsy
BAT (Brain AssistanT) is there for you to provide predictive insight into epileptic and narcoleptic events. With our open API you will be able to connect to an ecosystem of apps and services that integrate with BAT to offer new, customized experiences. Version 1.0 of BAT was made my Team MobGem lab, 26th June 2016.
